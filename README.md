# SmartContractPractice
A quick project that I came up with to learn more about Truffle and Smart Contracts. This contract is supposed to imitate a loan officer's ability to add,
view and approve applicants based on their credit score and credit age in years.

If you pull in this project for yourself and wish to use an editor other than Visual Studio Code you can delete the .vscode folder and create your own
Solidity compiler specifications. As for this project, it uses version 0.8.4
